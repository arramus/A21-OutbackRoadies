= ABOUT =
=========
Outback Roadies is an expansion for 7 Days to Die with an Australian theme.
The concept has a bit of a Mad Max type post-poco feel about it and includes a 7D2D version of 'The Compound' POI from Mad Max II.
SpecBytes from SpecBytes Gaming requested the hostile Australian themed animals and the EndZ team kindly assisted at all stages.

= INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS =
=============================
For manual installation, place the contents of the Mods folder inside your appdata or main directory Mods folder.
For Mod Launcher installation, simply follow the usual method of installing through the application.

=======================================
= 10K Australia Outback Roadies World =
=======================================
The 10K Australia Outback Roadies World by FluffyPanda is a big 10K one and has been zipped to reduce download time.
It is inside the Mods folders as 10K Australia Outback Roadies World.zip folder.
Unzip and place inside your GeneratedWorlds folder in the appdata or Mod Launcher folder, Data/Worlds folder in the main game.
FluffyPanda has already generated the files in it, and once placed in both the client and server folders, there will be no need to download it from the server.
This will reduce latency and assist players who are unable to download such large files if their connection isn't so great.
